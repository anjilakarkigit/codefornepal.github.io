&lt;p&gt;I am Binita Gyawali, a graduate of Computer Science and Information Technology from Butwal Multiple Campus. I have been exploring the fields of data science and artificial intelligence for about six months. My research interest is in different applications of data science and artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been working since my freshman year to fill the gender gap in the tech community of Nepal, especially Province no. 5. A strong proponent of girls’ coding, I co-founded Butwal Coder Girls, a non-profit organization, in 2016 to motivate girls in coding, either as a hobby or as a career. Now, after exploring data science and seeing the landscape of girls’ involvement in data science, I feel more girls should be encouraged to pursue careers in data science, data engineering, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have you learned from DataCamp\how DataCamp has benefitted you so far?&lt;/strong&gt; 
I had no prior experience with data science or programming. I wanted to learn Python programming and do some data science. As a result, I looked into instructions from a variety of places. I felt bewildered in the new world of programming and data science when I referred to those materials. Put it simply, there was too much to catch. Things were not as well arranged as I had hoped. As a result, I was frustrated and contemplated quitting programming at one point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But everything changed when I got access to DataCamp through Code for Nepal Fellowship program. I was finally able to organize my studies. DataCamp provided step-by-step instruction in the form of skill and career tracks. That was precisely what I needed. Another feature of this Fellowship that I like was the ability to learn anything I wanted in DataCamp. I struggled with basic programming principles on several instances, and happily, DataCamp allowed me to take any basic classes or view any basic programming videos I chose.  DataCamp acted as a mentor for me with its guided projects that inspired me to pursue Python and data science as a career because I was able to observe how the skills I gained were applied in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has the Data Fellowship from Code for Nepal supported you in your career growth?&lt;/strong&gt;
Despite being a major fan of data science, I never got the chance to work in it. I’d always wanted to understand how to convert raw data into a tidy, appealing manner. Presenting data in the form of beautiful graphs has always piqued my interest. When I was in school, I used to tinker with excel whenever I had any data. My bucket list item is to learn how to analyze data using mathematical models. Data cleansing, data analysis, data visualization, and data modeling are among my best hobbies to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quit my job to pursue my true calling: data science. I came across the data fellowship offered by Code for Nepal and Open Knowledge Nepal and applied instantly. The data fellowship encouraged me to follow my interest in data science by researching and beginning to combine my career in the field. Observing other students conduct intriguing work motivated me to leverage data to create data-driven analytical tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two months of diligently seeking the fellowship, I was offered a data science internship with Open Knowledge Nepal, which marked the start of my professional data science journey. Right now, I’m merely scratching the surface of data science. I aspire to improve in my career with time and experience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the other benefits of this Fellowship, apart from the datacamp subscription?&lt;/strong&gt; 
Bringing attention to DataCamp is one of the numerous ways Code for Nepal is attempting to assist us in developing data skills. This Fellowship has several advantages, including assisting in the development of my portfolio and encouraging networking. For me, the “Data Fellowship” is my first data science involvement, thus it is quite valuable. This fellowship program has stood out in my resume and reflected well in my portfolio, as attested by HR experts and project managers from the several firms I interviewed for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you believe the next step is in your career, and how can we help you get there?&lt;/strong&gt;
After completing my bachelor’s degree in computer science and information technology, I am eager to gain more experience in the field of computer vision and further develop my research interests. So, the next stage in my career will be to continue my education in America. As a result, I am excited to apply for a Ph.D. in computer science with a computer vision emphasis in the fall of 2022.
Code for Nepal, I believe, has a strong professional network both within and outside Nepal. It would be extremely beneficial if Code for Nepal could assist me in connecting with AI research professionals (such as Ph.D. students, researchers, professors, and others) with whom I could work as a research assistant (even on a volunteer basis) or receive mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Binita Gyawali</name></author><category term="highlight" /><category term="Datacampdonates" /><category term="Data Fellowship 2021" /><category term="CodeforNepal" /><summary type="html">Binita Gyawali, a graduate of Computer Science and Information Technology from Butwal Multiple Campus, data Science journey with Code for Nepal and Open Knowledge Nepal.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My Code For Nepal Data Fellowship Experience as an Actuarial Science Student</title><link href="/2021/06/26/My-Code-For-Nepal-Data-Fellowship-Experience-as-an-Actuarial-Science.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My Code For Nepal Data Fellowship Experience as an Actuarial Science Student" /><published>2021-06-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-06-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/2021/06/26/My-Code-For-Nepal-Data-Fellowship-Experience-as-an-Actuarial-Science</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2021/06/26/My-Code-For-Nepal-Data-Fellowship-Experience-as-an-Actuarial-Science.html">&lt;p&gt;Everyone who is reading my blog, hello and Namaste. Hello, my name is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/krishna-kumar-shrestha-20a35b172/&quot;&gt;Krishna Kumar Shrestha&lt;/a&gt;, and I am now studying for a bachelor’s degree in Actuarial Science at Tribhuvan University. I was born in Banepa and currently reside in Kathmandu. My favorite subject has always been mathematics, and I’ve always wanted to work in disciplines linked to mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to major in actuarial science, which entails a lot of statistics and mathematics. As an actuarial student, being able to interpret vast amounts of data is essential. I had been studying programming languages such as C, C++, MATLAB, and R to prepare for this. The only thing I lacked was practical data experience. I learned about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/2021/02/14/launching-a-fellowship-program-to-build-data-skills-of-over-500-nepalis-globally.html&quot;&gt;DataCamp fellowship from Code for Nepal&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago when browsing LinkedIn. I applied after learning of this and was fortunate enough to be chosen. After receiving the scholarship from Code for Nepal, I began working on projects to gain hands-on experience. But I had the impression that I lacked the necessary talents to execute them. So, from DataCamp, I chose a professional path as a Data Analyst utilizing R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past three months, DataCamp has been my best buddy and I am thoroughly enjoying the companionship it provides. I am grateful to Code for Nepal for allowing me to participate in this fellowship. DataCamp required a lot of hands-on coding, which I didn’t love at first. At times, I was concerned and wondered aloud, “Will I be able to stay motivated to finish this course?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as time went on, I found that practice questions had assisted me in learning more. Those inquiries compelled me to delve further into the intricacies, hunt for more information and groomed me along the way. You know, I used to earn very little XP because I couldn’t solve many questions at first, but I progressively tried, started solving problems on my own, and performed well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crucial thing I learned from this data fellowship is professionalism in data analysis. It has changed my vision to explore the data and I was able to generate innovative ideas from data. When I used to do my project in college, most of the time I got clean data for my analysis. But in the real world, the situation is completely different. Most of the time we will get unstructured and dirty data and we must spend too much time cleaning them. This means whatever we learned, cannot be applied until we clean them. So, what I found out is that the data camp has designed its track to fulfill these gaps and provide students with real-world skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m having so much fun at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datacamp.com&quot;&gt;DataCamp&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve decided to pursue a career as a Data Scientist using R because &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org&quot;&gt;Code for Nepal&lt;/a&gt; has motivated me to make the most of this opportunity. In a similar vein, I’m nearing the end of my certification process. Hopefully, I will complete the task and acquire DataCamp certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d like to thank the Code for Nepal team for giving me this opportunity and for arranging so many inspiring events for youth like me to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Krishna kumar Shrestha</name></author><category term="Datacampdonates" /><category term="Data Fellowship 2021" /><category term="CodeforNepal" /><summary type="html">Everyone who is reading my blog, hello and Namaste.

Looking back, it’s difficult for me to summarize the journey in words; almost 5 years went by within the blink of eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started, I wanted to be focused on leading one initiative, which was AskNepal; but as time progressed I remember volunteering for so many interdisciplinary projects, programs and positions. Unfortunately, this awesome journey will come to halt this April 2021, as I step down and bid farewell to Code for Nepal community. So yay, I might not be actively engaged in the community activities and projects from April onwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking this decision to bid farewell wasn’t easy for me but a year-long pandemic has made my personal and professional life a little messy; forcing me to take some major decisions to collect life back to normal. Also, I believe 5 years is a long time and this is a good time for me to move on; so other volunteers can utilize the community platform and get a similar opportunity to contribute and prove themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still will be wondering and struggling in the field of data and technology. So, if anyone wants to reach out; my email nikeshbalami@gmail.com) will be always open for collaboration. The aim is to make sure that everyone has free and open access to the key information, empowering themselves to be able to make decisions about their own lives based on the information that wasn’t available before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflecting on the journey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shaping AskNepal initiative - my project plan to &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/2016/10/rebooting-asknepal-initiative/&quot;&gt;reboot the entire initiative&lt;/a&gt; was a complete flop, but we made some progress in terms of further enhancing the project. We successfully brought the project under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://asknepal.info/en/help/about&quot;&gt;joint partnership&lt;/a&gt; of Open Knowledge Nepal and Code for Nepal, to ease its implementation. Also, with the support from OKN colleagues, Sagar Ghimire &amp;amp; Shubham Ghimire, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mysociety/asknepal-theme/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed&quot;&gt;improved the user interface&lt;/a&gt;. We also were able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.transifex.com/mysociety/alaveteli/&quot;&gt;localize the platform in the Nepali language&lt;/a&gt;, many thanks to the volunteers of Kathmandu University and the guidance of Saroj Dhakal. Unfortunately, we were never able to acquire dedicated funding to support the outreach activities of the project. The good-looking project proposal remains in my Google drive. If someone is still looking to support, feel free to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizing #DigitalNepal conference - In the midst of tragic events and strike at province 2, we successfully organized the Digital Nepal conference at Janakpur, which was one of the biggest out of Kathmandu valley technology events. A little nervous, a little excited; I remember my friend Avinash and I, taking a flight from Kathmandu. It was all worth it and many thanks to Pratap Adhikari, who then was a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ayon.org&quot;&gt;Association of Youth Organizations Nepal (AYON)&lt;/a&gt;, for making it memorable, by helping us explore the entire Janakpur. You can read my take on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/2017/04/diversity-and-enthusiasm-my-take-on-digital-nepal-conference-janakpur/&quot;&gt;Digital Nepal conference&lt;/a&gt;, the event was full of enthusiasm with diverse audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building civic tools - Something I love, crowdsourcing the idea and converting it into impactful projects with the help of wonderful volunteers. Out of many, one of the memorable projects was the &lt;a href=&quot;(https://codefornepal.org/2017/04/election-nepal-a-mediator-between-citizens-and-government-for-election-data/)&quot;&gt;Election Nepal portal&lt;/a&gt;, although the portal wasn’t sustainable for a longer period. I have shared the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/open-nepal/online-collaboration-by-nepals-data-community-yields-a-portal-for-opening-local-election-data-d425986f8194&quot;&gt;journey of online collaboration in building the portal&lt;/a&gt; with the Open Nepal team, feel free to read. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/okfnepal/election-nepal&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/okfnepal/election-nepal-data&quot;&gt;datasets&lt;/a&gt; are also openly available for everyone to reuse. Another project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visitjanakpur.com/&quot;&gt;Visit Janakpur&lt;/a&gt;, I wasn’t involved in the development of the project, but helping the team organize the “Digitizing Janakpur Workshop” was fun. At the end of the three and half days workshop, we built 542 map points, 55 plus 360-degree imageries and 12 video stories. You can read more details regarding how we helped improve the digital footprint of Janakpur from my [blog]https://codefornepal.org/2018/11/improving-digital-footprint-of-janakpur/.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosting local and global events - In the span of 5 years, I remember helping in the coordination of many events, that too in various parts of the country. Some of them include Smart Cities Workshop, in partnership with Global Peace Foundation; AngelHack Hackathon with support from ING Group, DataHack 2019 to map the districts affected by the monsoon in Nepal, 2019 Digitizing Janakpur Workshop to map the street of Janakpur on OpenStreetMap and Digital Literacy Training at Sindhupalchowk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving NepalMap portal - When I first joined Code for Nepal community; NepalMap was already a thing with a very good user base. I feel very grateful that I got an opportunity to work with both teams who developed the old pre-federal and new federal version of NepalMap, especially with Clifton McIntosh, who despite being non-Nepali got such a deep understanding of Nepal. In the pre-federal version, I contributed the local elections and business data. Adding business data was fun, where I spent quite some nights understanding its patterns, you can read &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/2017/09/understanding-the-patterns-business-data-added-in-nepalmap/&quot;&gt;my experience regarding the understanding of the business data pattern&lt;/a&gt;. Which gave me confidence in coordinating the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/2020/02/nepalmap-federal-explore-and-understand-nepal-using-data/&quot;&gt;development of the federal version&lt;/a&gt;. Many thanks to Clifton McIntosh, Amit Chaudhary, Nitesh Rijal, Pratima Kandel, Ishan Dangol and Nirmal Rijal; without whom the development of &lt;a href=&quot;https://nepalmap.org/&quot;&gt;NepalMap Federal&lt;/a&gt; would not have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launching fellowship - Helping with the launch and coordination of the different fellowship programs was also one of the memorable parts of the journey. Recent activities include the launch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/fellowship/&quot;&gt;Hawkins Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/2021/02/14/launching-a-fellowship-program-to-build-data-skills-of-over-500-nepalis-globally.html&quot;&gt;Data Fellowship program&lt;/a&gt;, where we aim to build data skills of over 500 Nepalis globally. If you are someone who is looking for any opportunity to kickstart the carrier in the field of data, feel free to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I previously mentioned, my focus will still be in the field of data and technology, so if you are someone who works in a similar field, we definitely have a higher chance of meeting and working again. In the end, I would like to thank Ravi Kumar for his mentorship; without him, this phase of life could have been boring.&lt;/p&gt;

. I am a mechanical engineering student. I received my bachelor’s degree in 2019 from Kathmandu University. Many technological advancements radically modified machines over time, due to researchers and scientists that worked tirelessly to make things happen the way they are now. Machines, which were completely mechanically driven only a few years ago, have now begun to work automatically, thanks to programming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other technologies. This progress piqued my curiosity, which evolved into a desire to pursue Mechanical Engineering as a bachelor’s degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But during my college years, I was not interested in programming; C and C++ were the only two classes I had taken in my first year. Every year, we were also required to complete engineering project work as part of our course credit. I realized the true usefulness of programming when I was in my third year because it was and still is used in almost every field. The synergistic pairing of mechanical engineering and computer science helps the upskilling in this domain. I deduced, “It is the future.” My desire to learn python grew even stronger thereafter, thanks to its simple syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned about the DataCamp in 2020 from a Facebook ad. I impulsively registered for one of the courses because it was available for a limited time for free. In 2021, I accessed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datacamp.com/donates&quot;&gt;DataCamp&lt;/a&gt;
 for the second time, this time as a Data Fellow at Code for Nepal. I’ve enrolled in the Python Programmer and Machine Learning career track, as well as numerous other python programming courses that have helped me to develop my basic coding skills. Because I had no idea what basic coding abilities a mechanical engineer would need, I began taking courses at random, in a rush to learn everything that came my way, whether it was relevant or irrelevant to my career. I used to wonder after enrolling in a course, “Is this the right course for me?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wished DataCamp had a career track titled Python for Mechanical Engineers to make things easier. I’m not sure if one exists. It took me approximately two and a half months to figure out what to learn and what to disregard at DataCamp, which covers a wide range of topics. I learned and am currently learning fundamental programming skills and tools through the Code for Nepal fellowship. It is an accomplishment for me to have progressed from nothing to something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still undecided about what I want to pursue as a career, but I’m interested in becoming an automation engineer, a data scientist, or a mechanical design engineer, to name a few. Being a Data Fellow at Code for Nepal has been quite beneficial in assisting me in achieving my goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I progress in my datacamp career tracks I have realized just like how Steve Jobs said in a famous Stanford commencement speech “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward”  I have to believe that the dots (code skills) will connect to what I’ll be doing in the future. Believing that the dots will join in the future motivates me to keep doing what I’m doing today. We’re getting closer to the end of the DataCamp fellowship with each passing day, and I’m starting to acquire a sense of how to make the most of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunity to participate in the Code for Nepal fellowship was one of the nicest things that have ever occurred to me, and I am grateful to Code for Nepal for providing me with this fantastic opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nabin Joshi</name></author><summary type="html">I am Nabin Joshi, aData fellow at Code for Nepal .

&lt;p&gt;If you ask me if my gap year has taught me anything significant, I’d say that seeking knowledge continuously is the one thing that has stayed with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Code for Nepal came at the right time to act as a bridge when I was searching for ways to learn data science for free! How?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code for Nepal launched its fellowship program where fellows would get access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datacamp.com/donates&quot;&gt;DataCamp&lt;/a&gt; for $0!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt like I hit the jackpot and I didn’t think twice before applying because I knew it was the right fit for me. DataCamp as part of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/datacamp-donates-50-partners&quot;&gt;global effort&lt;/a&gt; to build data skills donated thousands of subscriptions to organizations and schools globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a fellow at Code for Nepal, I got access to a multitude of courses and resources via &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/2021/02/14/launching-a-fellowship-program-to-build-data-skills-of-over-500-nepalis-globally&quot;&gt;Data Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; which let me dive deep into the data world like never before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was euphoric to re-learn courses interactively which I had learned via different online courses that were like traditional classes but on a computer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with Datacamp, I could code simultaneously while getting instructions. Subsequently, my learning time grew exponentially!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the time of my life exploring Business Analytics courses during my gap year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustrated, I started recording my eating habits on an excel sheet and visualized it to find patterns between my diet and its influence on my sinus problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding that dairy products and low water consumption was related to surged congestion and toothache, I changed my diet and increased water consumption to improve my health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also increased my yoga time after noticing a pattern between reduced toothache and increased yoga duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, my interest in Analytics grew even more. I plan to utilize the robust analytics program at Datacamp to shape solutions to people’s problems like I did for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datacamp has courses that have helped me leverage data tools, maintaining databases, and creating and managing data analytics that helps me connect dots between marketing and analytics, improving my problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the tools, I was able to identify students’ major issues (analysis) and address them in collaboration with our startup- TheVidhwan’s- student ambassadors by acquiring and analyzing 300 student data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During college, I aspire to continue connecting the dots between marketing and analytics thereby improving my problem-solving skills. Through analysis and models, I want to create patterns and unravel mysteries about people’s behavior to have a deeper understanding of their problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And through marketing, I plan to shape creative ideas to connect and communicate with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Data Fellowship has allowed me to indulge myself with guided and self-started projects which adds a whole new perspective to my experience as I tackle real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Datacamp has made it easy enough for me to execute such projects at the comfort of my home sipping coffee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my project, I collected, analyzed, and visualized company data of Pacific Human Resources Pvt. Ltd that is being used for the company’s marketing and its website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the community that we have at Code for Nepal Fellowship is just what I needed while struggling with my project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our monthly session that is led by the founder himself allowed me to get my questions answered by him and other data professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capitalizing on the power of data has helped me realize how much progress we need to make as a country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for that reason, I am starting the change with myself and the people around me!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nigin Pun</name></author><category term="highlight" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Donate to save lives and help Nepalis fight COVID-19 Pandemic</title><link href="/2021/05/02/donate-to-save-lives-and-help-nepalis-fight-COVID-19-pandemic.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Donate to save lives and help Nepalis fight COVID-19 Pandemic" /><published>2021-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/2021/05/02/donate-to-save-lives-and-help-nepalis-fight-COVID-19-pandemic</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2021/05/02/donate-to-save-lives-and-help-nepalis-fight-COVID-19-pandemic.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://unsdg.un.org/sites/default/files/2020-07/nepal_covid_july2020_960x640.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nepal has run out of hospital beds due to rapidly rising COVID-19 cases. The Health Ministry has said that the situation is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/01/world/nepal-india-covid.html&quot;&gt;“unmanageable”&lt;/a&gt;. Just a few weeks ago, Nepal was recording fewer than 100 cases a day. On May 1, it recorded over 7,000 COVID-19 cases. Data suggests Nepal currently has one of the highest positivity rates in the world and is on track to double its COVID cases every five days. There are tons of people who have lost their daily income and are in need of immediate relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fundraiser is intended to help bring much needed resources to people within and outside of Kathmandu including but not limited to meals to those in need and medical professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to raise &lt;strong&gt;USD 15,000&lt;/strong&gt;. All your donations are tax deductible in the US. We also encourage you to speak with your employer to explore the possibility of employer matching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also working to support families who have lost their sole breadwinners and have no source of income. At this rate, it is very likely that there will be scores of families without a source of income and in need of basic supplies to survive on a daily basis within and outside of Kathmandu Valley. With our network of partners all over the country, especially in the Southern border of Nepal that is being hit terribly, we aim to expand our support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In college, I am planning to study computer science and economics. However, I did not want to wait to learn the basics of data science till I got to college. In that sense, Datacamp has truly helped me overcome the barriers of time and space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datacamp.com/&quot;&gt;DataCamp&lt;/a&gt; as a member of Code for Nepal, a non-profit organization working to increase digital literacy and data literacy in Nepal. DataCamp as part of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/datacamp-donates-50-partners&quot;&gt;global effort&lt;/a&gt; to build data skills donated thousands of subscriptions to organizations and schools globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I worked to enhance the learning experiences of 100s of others who were selected as Code for Nepal’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/2021/02/14/launching-a-fellowship-program-to-build-data-skills-of-over-500-nepalis-globally&quot;&gt;Data Fellows&lt;/a&gt;, I was increasing my own knowledge of data science and familiarity with DataCamp. The courses on datacamp are developed to meet the expectations of learners at every level including one like myself. I have realized that to ensure the quality of learning and include the needs of different types of learners, tools like podcasts, hints, assessments have been developed. I have found them very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, students can rate the courses and give feedback about their learning experience to DataCamp which helps improve the courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no prior experience with programming languages. I knew a little bit of HTML and Q-basic that I had learned in middle school. As a total beginner at the start of my datacamp journey, I discovered ‘Introduction to python’, “Introduction to R”, and “Introduction to SQL, are free courses on Datacamp and they were the perfect place to start. After I finished these free courses I took a skilled assessment which recommended me to learn Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step in my journey was to start my first lesson on DataCamp. This is where I had to decide to make a decision of whether I wanted to start with an individual course or a track. The courses started with very basic: types, variables, basic calculations. Therefore even as a beginner that has never written or read a single line of code, I was able to follow the material presented very easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The courses on DataCamp take place on your browser so you don’t have to download anything to learn. I am very impressed with the concept of interactive e-learning with DataCamp as it allowed me to become active with my own learning experience. Interestingly Datacamp XP is a symbolic point-system that rewards learners like me for engaging in learning. XP is awarded to learners for progressing in courses, exercises, and projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I use hints or show answer methods for solving problems a certain amount of my XP was used which motivated me to try and solve problems on my own as I did not want to lose the hard-earned XP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datacamp also has a section dedicated to getting real-life experience with projects. I have some courses bookmarked so that I know what I have next on my list to achieve and I can revise by taking assessments that are already there on datacamp for me. On the live events tab, there are always upcoming events which has webinars and live training sessions to learn about data-driven organizations. I am thrilled to learn new things every day and datacamp feels like a roadmap where I am on a data car that leads me safely by minimizing risk and providing clarity to reach my destination as a data scientist. This journey has to be my favorite of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, let me share that when I finished my first-course introduction to python I was very proud of myself. After all, I managed to accomplish a significant step towards eventually becoming a data expert. I realized that becoming data fluent would require more time and dedication. I look forward to completing more courses, tracks, and projects that DataCamp has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be the fact that all our fellows at DataCamp have a positive experience with different courses like python, R, SQL, and Machine learning. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a high school student, I realized it is necessary to reinforce the various learning Opportunities that prioritizes strengthening my data skills and DataCamp was the best platform for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks, I will share how others in our community are using DataCamp. In the meantime, I would be curious to hear about your experience in coding. Please share your experiences or thoughts in the comment section below.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Anshu Adhikari</name></author><category term="highlight" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Launching a Fellowship program to build data skills of over 500 Nepalis globally</title><link href="/2021/02/14/launching-a-fellowship-program-to-build-data-skills-of-over-500-nepalis-globally.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Launching a Fellowship program to build data skills of over 500 Nepalis globally" /><published>2021-02-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/2021/02/14/launching-a-fellowship-program-to-build-data-skills-of-over-500-nepalis-globally</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2021/02/14/launching-a-fellowship-program-to-build-data-skills-of-over-500-nepalis-globally.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/data-fellowship/assets/og-image.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Launching a Fellowship program to build data skills of over 500 Nepalis globally&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to launch &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/data-fellowship/&quot;&gt;Data Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; to build the data skills of over 500 Nepalis. There are only two criteria to apply for this fellowship. First, applicants must be able to commit at least 5-10 hours per week for the first 2-3 months. Second, they should be curious and interested in learning new skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applicants can be based anywhere. They can come from any background. They can be students, professionals, or unemployed. We highly encourage women and especially people from provinces 2 and 6 to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where everything is digitized, data skills have become critical. The ability to find, analyze and use data can not only help one do well professionally but also lead a more meaningful life. During this historic and tragic pandemic, we have been seen how people and businesses that are digitally connected and data-savvy can withstand the crisis compared to those who are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any Nepali who is keen on making progress personally, professionally, or tackling a challenge in their community will benefit from this fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fellowship provides a safe and convenient opportunity for Nepalis to gain new skills. Those who have access to the Internet and a laptop can take courses at their own convenience and earn certificates. The Fellows will also have the opportunity to virtually contribute to civic technology and open data products such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://opendatanepal.com/&quot;&gt;Open Data Nepal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nepalmap.org/&quot;&gt;NepalMap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://asknepal.info/&quot;&gt;AskNepal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sangraha.org/&quot;&gt;Sangraha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total monetary value of the program is over USD 200,000 or 2 crore Nepali rupees. This fellowship would not have been possible without the generous support of &lt;a href=&quot;https://datacamp.com&quot;&gt;DataCamp&lt;/a&gt;, a leader in building the data skills of people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Knowledge Nepal and Code for Nepal have partnered to offer support for career opportunities and mentorship to Fellows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selected Fellows can choose to take classes from DataCamp experts at their own convenience to become Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Data Analysts, or Quantitative Analysts. If a Fellow has completed a certain career track and is interested in learning more skills from DataCamp, we would be keen to support that as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome you to apply and help us spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ravi Kumar</name></author><category term="highlight" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nepal has increased dramatically’</title><link href="/2020/11/21/cumulative-number-of-confirmed-cases.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nepal has increased dramatically’" /><published>2020-11-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/2020/11/21/cumulative-number-of-confirmed-cases</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2020/11/21/cumulative-number-of-confirmed-cases.html">&lt;p&gt;Just 6 months ago, Nepal had just 1,500 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nepal.
